## Summary
The user is working on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that appears to be a course assignment tracker for multiple subjects across different semesters. The table lists various courses with their respective assignments, deadlines, and completion status. The data is organized chronologically from February 12, 2025, to May 16, 2025, indicating the user's academic planning and progress tracking for the Spring'25 semester. The user has marked all assignments as completed ('1' in the 'FINISHED' column), suggesting that the data is either historical or being used for planning purposes. The presence of multiple courses and assignments indicates a heavy academic workload, likely for a student managing various subjects and deadlines.
