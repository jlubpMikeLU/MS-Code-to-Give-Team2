2.3.1 Architecture of the RAG Model
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model is designed for text generation tasks, performing a process that involves retrieving information from given source data and utilizing that information to generate desired text.
Fig 6 illustrates the data processing pipeline for RAG usage, involving breaking down the original data into smaller chunks and converting text data into numerical vectors through embedding, which are then stored in a vector repository [13].
Source Data Collection and Preparation: Relevant source data is required for the model's training and utilization. This data can include documents, web pages, news articles, etc. It forms the foundation for the model to search for and generate content.
Chunking of Searchable Units: Source data is divided into smaller units known as chunks. Chunks are typically small text fragments, such as sentences or paragraphs, making it easier to search for and utilize information at this granular level.
Embedding: Generated chunks undergo embedding, a process of converting text into meaningful vector representations. Pre-trained language models are often used to transform text into dense vectors, capturing the meaning and related information in vector form.
Construction of Vector Database: A vector database is built based on the embedded chunks. This database represents the positions of each chunk within the vector space, enabling efficient retrieval and similarity calculations.
Search and Information Integration: To retrieve information relevant to the context of the text to be generated, appropriate chunks are searched within the vector database. The retrieved chunks are decoded back into original text data to extract information, which is then utilized during the generation process.
Text Generation: Using the retrieved information as a basis, text is generated. Users can specify the type, length, and linguistic style of the text to be generated. The RAG model is designed to seamlessly integrate information retrieval and generation processes, aiming to produce more accurate and meaningful text outputs.
