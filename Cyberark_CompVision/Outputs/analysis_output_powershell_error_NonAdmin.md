## Summary
The user is working with Windows PowerShell, attempting to execute the 'Get-PSDrive' command to list drives. Initially, the command fails due to a typo in the '-PSProvider' parameter, which is corrected from 'FileSyste' to 'FileSystem'. Upon correction, the command successfully lists the 'C' drive, showing its used and free space. The user is likely troubleshooting or learning PowerShell commands. Google Chrome is open with multiple tabs, possibly for reference or research, including searches related to 'network firewall', 'Azure Network building exercise', and 'powershell command to list disk'. The user's workflow involves using PowerShell for system management tasks and referencing online resources.
